# Super-Hasher




A Python tool that splits your input into 5 parts, hashes each part with a different algorithm, shuffles the results, and combines them into one scrambled hash string.

## Features

- Splits input string into 5 parts
- Hashes each part with a unique algorithm (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA3_512, BLAKE2b)
- Shuffles and concatenates hashed parts for obfuscation
- Simple command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Usage

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Brachisaurus-Hasher.git
   cd Brachisaurus-Hasher

   ```

   ```bash
   python scramble_hasher.py
